# pathfinder
This is a little game build from scratch using only jquery and bootstrap. 

Find your way from your starting location to the exit. You can only open new rooms adjacent to already visited rooms.
The Map is build randomly and every tile has a random number of connections to adjacent tiles.

Good Luck.
